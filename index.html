<h3>multimediaWin64</h3>

<p>Scripts for building open-source multimedia utilities for Win64 from a Cygwin64 installation. Centrepiece is FFmpeg. Includes FFmpeg, sox, MP4Box, raw2bmx and many other BBC MXF utilities and libraries, opusenc, lame, libcdio, exiv2 and many others and their associated libraries. The compiled programs are native Windows 64-bit binaries, and do not require Cygwin libraries.</p>


<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>


<p>Supporting the cross-compilation of the very versatile FFmpeg utilities under mingw64, Zeranoe and others publish a set of patches and a build script to, first, compile a working mingw64 environment on a POSIX system, then compile a very full FFmpeg and associated libraries and utilities within mingw64 ready for installation on a Windows 64-bit system.

<p>With grateful thanks to Zeranoe and other developers, I have extended this build system for my own purposes. A more comprehensive set of command-line utilities for multimedia work is build on Cygwin64 using my script.

<p>Because this is my own personal build system (Windows 8.1 64-bit with Cygwin64), I have probably severely compromised compatibility with other POSIX-compatible systems e.g. Linux. Restoring this compatibility is a task for the future.


<h3>HOW TO</h3>

<ol>
<li>Install Cygwin64. Make sure you have the facility to build programs using a very recent version of the Gnu Compiler Collection. Currently, I use gcc-4.9.0
<li>Checkout the scripts cross_compile_ffmpeg_cygwin64.sh and build.sh
<li>Make sure they are both executable
<li>Run ./build.sh. This launches the other script in a controlled manner that I have tested
<li>Wait quite a long time
<li>Copy binaries from ./sandbox/mingw-w64-x86_64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin and other files (e.g. ../doc/) as needed
<li>Enjoy and share
<li>Run the command again to incorporate updates. Only the parts that need rebuilding will be built.
</ol>

<p>I have tested neither other command lines nor other builds.
