AviSynth+ binaries

These are my 64-bit Windows binaries compiled on 28th March 2015 from
the GitHub source code for AviSynth+ r.1825. (branch: MT - multithreaded)

Source code available here: https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus

If you have already installed AviSynth+ from an installer, merely replace the
dll in C:\Windows\System32 with my dll from the 'System32 DLL' directory,
and put the plugins into your own plugin directory. On my system, this is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\AviSynth+\plugins64+

john@johnwarburton.net

Licence identical to AviSynth+
